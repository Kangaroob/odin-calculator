Calculator assignment for The ODIN Project

I threw this together before actually going through the JavaScript lesssons, to see if I could do it, so I'm sure there are ways to optimize this code. For example (To Do):

    -Keep the text in Display from overflowing (try 1/9999 to see bug)

    -Allow 7-digit number in str after (-) is added (currently if (-) is
        pressed before 7 digits are entered it limits to 6 digits until 
        (-) is removed)

    --- 

    -Adjust calc-body to fill viewscreen Height

    -Make text in Disply auto-resize to keep from overflowing
        +Allow longer str length (to input longer numbers)
    
    ---

    -Automatically display Mobile site when viewed from Mobile device, 
        and Desktop when viewed from Desktop device
    
    -Add Info button/screen

    ---

    -Possibly use something more concise than Switch for key recognition

    -Add key-binding configuration interface

    ---

    -Remove unused/redundant code

    -Organize/rearrange code
