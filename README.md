# odin-calculator
Calculator assignment for The ODIN Project

I threw this together before actually going through the JavaScript lesssons, to see if I could do it, so I'm sure there are ways to optimize this code. For example (To Do):

    -Adjust rounding for negative numbers

    -Make display change background color only when rounding has occurred

    -Adjust calc-body Height

    _______

    -Make text in Disply auto-resize to keep from overflowing
        +Allow longer str length (to input longer numbers)

    -Maybe replace instances of parseFloat() with Number()?

    -Automatically display Mobile site when viewed from Mobile device, 
        and Desktop when viewed from Desktop device
    
    -Add Info button/screen

    ---

    -Possibly use something more concise than Switch for key recognition

    -Add key-binding configuration interface

    -Maybe make it so clicking on buttons doesn't leave them focused (i.e. if you click + and then press Enter the calculator will run equals() instead of plus() )?

    -Remove unused/redundant code

    -Organize/rearrange code
